ENHANCED INSTRUCTIONS FOR BADR_MELLAL
======================================================================

🎯 QUALITY REQUIREMENTS FOR BEST RECOGNITION:
   - 5-10 high-quality photos minimum
   - Face should occupy 50-70% of the image
   - Clear, well-lit photos (avoid shadows on face)
   - Multiple angles: front, slight left, slight right
   - Different expressions: neutral, smiling
   - Avoid sunglasses, hats, or face coverings
   - Resolution: 640x640 pixels or higher
   - Sharp, non-blurry images

📸 RECOMMENDED PHOTO TYPES:
   1. badr_mellal_front_neutral.jpg (straight-on, neutral expression)
   2. badr_mellal_front_smile.jpg (straight-on, smiling)
   3. badr_mellal_left_angle.jpg (slight left turn)
   4. badr_mellal_right_angle.jpg (slight right turn)
   5. badr_mellal_up_angle.jpg (slight upward look)
   6. badr_mellal_down_angle.jpg (slight downward look)
   7. badr_mellal_different_lighting.jpg (different lighting condition)

⚠️ AVOID THESE ISSUES:
   - Blurry or out-of-focus images
   - Too much shadow or backlighting
   - Face too small in frame
   - Extreme angles or poses
   - Low resolution images
   - Images with other people's faces

🔧 AFTER ADDING PHOTOS:
   1. Run: python setup.py --add-faces
   2. Check validation results in logs
   3. If recognition issues persist, add more high-quality photos
   4. Use different lighting conditions for robustness

💡 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
   - Take photos in the same location where recognition will happen
   - Use similar lighting conditions as the surveillance area
   - Include photos with and without glasses if person wears them
   - Quality over quantity - 5 excellent photos > 10 poor photos

📊 The system uses ArcFace for recognition with enhanced preprocessing
   and quality validation to prevent misidentification issues.
